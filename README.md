# Osteosarcoma_Detection
Bone tumor detection using image processing and artificial intelligence (AI) involves analyzing medical images—typically X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs—to identify abnormal growths in bone tissue. The process uses computer vision techniques to pre-process images (e.g., filtering, segmentation) and extract features such as shape, texture, and intensity. These features are then fed into machine learning or deep learning models (like CNNs) to classify whether a tumor is benign, malignant, or absent.

Deep learning models—especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)—are trained on labeled datasets to classify the presence of osteosarcoma. Advanced models can also assess tumor grade and stage by analyzing cellular structures, tumor spread, and density patterns in the images.

This AI-based approach can improve early detection accuracy, reduce human error, and assist radiologists in faster diagnosis and treatment planning.
